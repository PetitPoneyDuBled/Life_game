# Life_game
Project of the life_game in c++

The program is inspired by the scientific game 'the game of life' which represents cells evolving in time according to certain given conditions.

Being interested in science in general, I programmed this game after seeing this game while watching a youtube video : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-W0NX97DB0

This project allowed me to consolidate my learning of the "object" aspect of c++.

You can place cells as you like with the life function, or place structures already available (oscillatorline, flower ... ) 
You can also change the size of the grid although it is limited by the terminal.

To make the code work, it must be executed in a terminal

Here is an example:
